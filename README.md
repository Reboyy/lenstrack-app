## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation Guide

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    - If you have cloned this project from GitHub, you can skip this step. Otherwise, clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    - Open your terminal in the project directory and run the following command to install all the necessary packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Firebase**
    - This application requires a Firebase project to handle the database and user authentication.
    - **a. Create a Firebase Project:**
        - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
        - Click on "Add project" and follow the on-screen instructions.
    - **b. Set Up Authentication:**
        - In your new Firebase project, go to the "Authentication" section from the left sidebar.
        - Click "Get started" and choose **Email/Password** from the list of sign-in methods.
        - Enable it and click "Save".
    - **c. Set Up Realtime Database:**
        - Go to the "Realtime Database" section (or "Build" > "Realtime Database").
        - Click "Create database" and choose a location.
        - Start in **test mode** for now (this allows read/write access without authentication rules, which is fine for local development).
    - **d. Get Your Firebase Config:**
        - Go to your Project Settings (click the ‚öôÔ∏è icon next to "Project Overview").
        - Scroll down to the "Your apps" section.
        - Click on the web icon `</>` to register a new web app.
        - Give it a nickname (e.g., "LensTrack Web") and click "Register app".
        - Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` object. Copy this object.
    - **e. Add Config to the Project:**
        - Open the file `src/lib/firebase.ts`.
        - **Replace** the existing `firebaseConfig` object with the one you copied from your Firebase project.

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables for AI (Optional but Recommended)**
    - For AI features to work, you need a Google AI API key.
    - **a. Get an API Key:**
        - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
        - Click "Create API key in new project".
        - Copy the generated API key.
    - **b. Add Key to Environment File:**
        - In the root of your project, find the `.env` file (if it doesn't exist, create it).
        - Add the following line, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key you just copied:
        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
        ```

### Running the Application

You need to run two processes in separate terminals for the full application (including AI features) to work.

1.  **Start the Main Application (Next.js):**
    - In your first terminal, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    - Your app should now be running at [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

2.  **Start the AI Service (Genkit):**
    - Open a **new, second terminal** in the same project directory.
    - Run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    - This starts the local server that handles all the AI-related requests.

Now you can open your browser, navigate to `http://localhost:9002`, and start using LensTrack Pro!
