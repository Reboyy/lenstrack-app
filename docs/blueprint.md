## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted teal (#45A29E) to represent stability and professionalism, avoiding the typical, overused teal.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F3), almost white, to maintain a clean and modern aesthetic.
- Accent color: A deep blue (#2A6F97), analogous to teal, providing contrast for calls to action and important elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines; body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, to balance modernity with readability. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use clean and professional icons related to client management and project tracking. Flat style with a subtle outline.
- Maintain a clean and well-organized layout with clear sections and intuitive navigation. Use white space effectively to avoid clutter.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience without being distracting. For example, a fade-in effect on content loading.
